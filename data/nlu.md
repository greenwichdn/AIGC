- A couple of thing like the construction site nearby is too noisy.
- Kind of, I feel like nobody could undersand what I feet and what I thought.
- My wife keeps yelling at me with my crying baby, so noisy
- I feel that my parents never wanted to support me

- I just feel so stressful about my job
- And the most annoying thing is my boss, aww so stressful
